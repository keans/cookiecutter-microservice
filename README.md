# Cookiecutter Microservice

This repository contains a simple 
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) to create a micro service. 
The micro service is based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and
uses oauth2 bearer tokens for authentication.


## Usage

Ensure that `cookiecutter` is installed, if not simply install it via `pip`

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Download the `cookiecutter-microservice` repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:keans/cookiecutter-microservice.git
```

Then, use `cookiecutter` to create the micro-service skeleton:

```
cookiecutter cookiecutter-microservice
```
